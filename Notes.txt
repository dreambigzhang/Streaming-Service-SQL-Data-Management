"For each session, a session number unique for the user should be assigned by your system"
-> primary key of sessions table is (uid, sno) so it's ok that sessions of different users have the
same sno

playlist pid alone is primary key, if new playlist, pid randomly generated + check if unique

Input database name as userinput

Don't make assumption on the format of IDs
