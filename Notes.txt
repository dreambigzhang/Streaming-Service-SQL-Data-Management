User action:
"For each session, a session number unique for the user should be assigned by your system"
-> primary key of sessions table is (uid, sno) so it's ok that sessions of different users have the
same sno

playlist pid alone is primary key, if new playlist, pid randomly generated + check if unique using query

Input database name as userinput

Don't make assumption on the format of IDs

Lady Gaga is a match for lad


search playlist: just match playlist name or check song title in the playlist too?

user cannot have more than 1 active session

don't forget to conn.commit() after every change to the database
